# Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship Project
### Predicting Polymer Properties via Graph Convolutional Network

Graph representations of molecules have been used to accurately predict the properties of polymers, in some cases with more success than typical feature-list molecular representations. The purpose of this project to explore the relationship between thermal and mechanical properties and structural characteristics of monomer units by implementing a graph convolutional network (GCN) to model and predict the glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm), and density (D) for polymers curated from the PolyInfo database.
